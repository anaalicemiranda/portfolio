    <h2>What is Nike Run Club?</h2>
    <p>NRC is a running app that offers detailed progress tracking, social features, personalized coaching and guided runs that motivate and inspire people to become better athletes.</p> 
    
    <h2>The Challenge</h2>
    <p>Creating a new feature for NRC that can improve the runner’s experience, be inovative and complement the features that the app already offers.</p> 
    
    <h2>The Feature</h2>
