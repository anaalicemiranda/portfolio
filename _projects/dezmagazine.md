    <h2>The Challenge</h2>
    <p>The challenge was to create a periodical publication whose main theme was around plastic.</p> 
    <p>DEZ Magazine was the materialization of that process. As an independent and experimental publication, it aims to give space to several artists with the aim of creating dialogue on the plastic theme in its most varied forms</p>

    <h2>The Magazine</h2>
    <p>For each issue there is a specific theme, inserted in the big theme: Plastic. Artists are invited to each TEN edition, who create a set of images for the theme.</p>
    <p>This first edition of “Plastic Food” explores the theme, hyperbolizing situations and creating visual metaphors through the artistic side. As a complement to the print edition, the site gives access to some exclusive content.</p>
    <p>Annually, an exhibition is also organized with the works that integrate the magazine and artistic installations with artists invited to intervene in the space.</p>
